Revision history for Perl extension DBIx-Transaction.

0.005   2006/01/13
        - After discussion on <dbi-users@perl.org> and <perl-qa@perl.org>,
          switch to only depending on DBD::SQLite2 if AUTOMATED_TESTING
          is set: that way, smoke testers need it to get a green light on
          testers.cpan.org, but end users don't.

0.004   2006/01/11
        - Use DBI_DSN for the default testing DSN, if available
        - Make automated testing more reliable by depending on DBD::SQLite2
          if we're testing against it, since it's the default.

0.003   2005/12/30
        - Added a new "transaction()" convienence method which
          runs a block of code inside a transaction. (db.pm)

0.002   2005/11/30
        - Made do() and execute() poison a transaction if there is an
          error. This is the "lowest common denominator" DBMS behaviour
          so enforcing it here makes all DBMS have the same error behaviour
          (one error ruins the whole transaction) when running under
          DBIx::Transaction.

0.001   2005/11/25
        - Initial public release
