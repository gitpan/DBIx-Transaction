Revision history for Perl extension DBIx-Transaction.

0.003   2005/12/30
        - Added a new "transaction()" convienence method which
          runs a block of code inside a transaction. (db.pm)

0.002   2005/11/30
        - Made do() and execute() poison a transaction if there is an
          error. This is the "lowest common denominator" DBMS behaviour
          so enforcing it here makes all DBMS have the same error behaviour
          (one error ruins the whole transaction) when running under
          DBIx::Transaction.

0.001   2005/11/25
        - Initial public release
